## Tron Legacy Syntax theme

WIP

!pic goes here

This theme is a merge of [One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) with [Riari/tron-legacy-atom](https://github.com/Riari/tron-legacy-atom) which is an Atom editor adaptation of [daylerees's TronLegacy](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes/blob/master/legacy/TronLegacy.tmTheme) syntax theme.

Riari did a great job of representing the spirit of Tron Legacy, but didn't track the project structure on One Dark.  The goal here is to port over Riari's work into a theme project structure based on One Dark, and fix some color inconsistencies I found with some language syntax highlights, specifically around the built in Javascript language definition.

> The UI theme is One Dark, which ships with atom and matches the color scheme.
